# The Batchelor Family

This organization contains various code repositories to act as a showcase for members of the Batchelor household.
This is a space to collaborate as we continue to automate our lives.

  I'm a budding Frontend Engineer who has been partying with websites since 1999.
  I like picking up new technologies and code languages if they can assist me with solving of all my world's problems.

  I'm a small child starting Kindergarten who has not yet learned to read.
  Obviously I am not typing this message, and it will be some time before you see any contributions from my end.
  For now I am primarily a source of toil but also a passion project for my loving parents.

  Pet | Fuzzball | House Cat

  I am a Bengal cat who supervises the household and ensures that my loyal subjects continue their edible tributes. If you find any typos throughout  these projects, rest assured it was my contribution. Obviously I'm not filling in my own bio... I have `people` to do that for me.

## Finished Projects
