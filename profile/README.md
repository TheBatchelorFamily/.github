# The Batchelor Family

This organization contains various code repositories to act as a showcase for members of the Batchelor household.
This is a space to collaborate as we continue to automate our lives.

## Member Profiles

* [Chris Batchelor](https://github.com/christhebatchelor)
  
  Father | Husband | DevOps Engineer

  I'm a DevOps engineer by trade who has been interested in technology since I was old enough to mash buttons.
  I'm now working towards leveraging these skills at home to bring even more technology into our increasingly high-tech lifestyle.

* [Megan Batchelor](https://github.com/fiercekitti)
  
  Mother | Wife | Frontend Engineer
  <!-- textlint-disable -->
  I'm a budding Frontend Engineer who has been partying with websites since AngelFire was a new kid on the block.<!-- textlint-enable -->
  I enjoy finding ways to leverage new technologies and programming languages to solve the latest problem of the day.
  My friends joke around that I'm like an `old-lady` as I enjoy spending time crocheting, have a general disdain for loud music, and tend to rise with the sun and follow it to bed.

* [Chloe Batchelor](https://github.com/not_yet_active)
  
  Daughter | Padawan | Can't yet read

  I'm a small child starting Kindergarten who has not yet learned to read.
  Obviously I am not typing this message, and it will be some time before you see any contributions from my end.
  For now I am primarily a source of toil but also a passion project for my loving parents.

* [Maya](https://github.com/iambutacat)

  Pet | Fuzzball | House Cat

  I am a Bengal cat who supervises the household and ensures that my loyal subjects continue their edible tributes. If you find any typos throughout  these projects, rest assured it was my contribution. Obviously I'm not filling in my own bio... I have `people` to do that for me.

## Finished Projects

* [Shared GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TheBatchelorFamily/SharedGHA)
  
  This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that can be utilized by multiple projects within this GitHub organization. The intention is that additional workflows will be added overtime as necessary.

* [Shared Terraform Modules](https://github.com/TheBatchelorFamily/SharedTerraform)

  This repository centralizes the storage and maintenance of the various Terraform modules used by projects within this organization.

* [Megan's Portfolio site](https://github.com/TheBatchelorFamily/Megans_Portfolio_Website)

  This is the repository that houses the main portfolio site. This site is intended to showcase Megan's talent as a frontend web developer, and in the future offer Chris a space to blog about some of his projects.

## Works in Progress

* [K3s cluster](https://github.com/TheBatchelorFamily/HomeInfra)

  This repository houses the ansible config for the K3s kubernetes cluster Chris is currently working on.
